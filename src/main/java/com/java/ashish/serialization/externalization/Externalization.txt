Java Externalizable Interface
    If you notice the java serialization process, it’s done automatically. Sometimes we want to obscure the object data to maintain it’s integrity. We can do this by implementing java.io.Externalizable interface and provide implementation of writeExternal() and readExternal() methods to be used in serialization process.
    Notice that I have changed the field values in these methods of Person class before converting it to Stream and then while reading reversed the changes. In this way, we can maintain data integrity of some sorts. We can throw exception if after reading the stream data, the integrity checks fail. Let’s write a test program to see it in action.
