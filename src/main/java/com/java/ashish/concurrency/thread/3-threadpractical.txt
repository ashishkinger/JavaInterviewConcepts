Thread Signaling
    Java contains a set of features that enable thread to send signals to each other, and for threads to wait for such signals. For instance, a thread B might wait for a signal from thread A indicating that data is ready to be processed.

    The thread signaling features in Java are implemented via the wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods that are part of the the Object class which all Java classes extend.
